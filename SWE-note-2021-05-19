 Advanced Software Engineering Notes

What is software engineering?

* One of several definitions:

°

Software engineering is the technological and managerial discipline concerned with
systematic production and maintenance of software products that are developed and
modified on time and within cost estimates

e Software engineering includes:

°

°

Development methodologies

Quality assurance, verification and validation, and testing
Software construction

Architecture

e Software engineering includes:

°

Development methodologies

Project and team management

Quality assurance, verification and validation, and testing

Software construction

Architecture and design

Requirements elicitation and specification

Professional ethics

Proper coding, including following and creating APIs and documentation
And a lot more...

e = Oversimplification

Earlier courses taught you what programming is and how to learn to program

Other required courses teach you 
how to make better programs (i.e. Algorithms)

Later courses (i.e. electives) teach you about particular domains

This course teaches you how to use those skills in a professional environment to work in
a team to build something that you are relatively confident won't fail and is worth other
people spending money on it

e Ata high level, SE is concerned with the steps of the development process:

°

Requirements

Design / Specification
Programming / Construction / Implementation
Testing (Verification and Validation)
Production and Release

Maintenance and Updates

«© Why is SE different?

0000

Software is malleable / changeable

Requirements often change DURING development

Requirements often change AFTER development

Optimism from programming teams (“Of course we can add that feature!”)
